== TODO ==
* (Done) If first line of note was changed, update title before saving
* (Done) While typing the first line should always be large and blue
* (Done) After save emit "noteChanged" signal. With that signal update the list of all notes. Date and Title. Implement onNoteTitleChanged().
* (Done) Fix dates and times of notes
* (Done) Save if switched to list view
* (Done) Problem with list handling if lists have gaps. E.g. jumping from level 4 to level 2.
* (Done) Indenting lists is still a mayor problem. Main problem: Can't start lists on level other then 1. Using only indenting to identify list depth does not work, because of missing list decorations (but could be done manually).
* (Done) Adjust text editor to work with new list handling.
* (Done) If first list-item in editor is on level2, save fails
* (Done) Pressing 'Enter' in list needs to add bullet to next line
* (Done) Pressing 'Backspace' in list needs to decrease indent if cursor on bullet
* (Done) Pressing 'Delete' in list needs to decrease indent if cursor on bullet
* (Done) Use single instance mode
* (Done) Pressing 'Enter' in note title takes the formatting to the next line. Result: Blue underlined text.
* (Done) Move all formattings to a central place
* (Done) Font on real device way to small / Font in Simulator way to large

* Try using QGraphicsTextItem instead of QTextEdit. Maybe the performance is better because we don't need the proxy item.
* Make sure note titles are unique
* Preedit (word suggestions) should be displayed in the target format
* Use Booster to decrease startup time http://harmattan-dev.nokia.com/unstable/beta/api_refs/xml/daily-docs/applauncherd/qmlboost.html (>> See 2. Utilizing the booster cache)
* Parse notes *after* launching UI to decrease startup time
* Unknown tags need to be added to the QTextDocument. Otherwise we can't write them back later and might loose information that is important for some Tomboy plug-in. Try to Use custom properties in QTextFormat.
* Everything (esp. lists) need to work correctly if selections over multiple lines exist
* Entering text in front of a bullet or directly behind it shoudn't be allowed. Instead, place cursor after bullet and insert there.
* Pressing 'Delete' at the end of a list item needs to join it with the next line
* Sometimes no input possible. Then no virtual keyboard pops up on real device
